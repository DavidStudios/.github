## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I make games and build code here on GitHub.

One of my current GitHub+Roblox projects is GuiService, built only on Lua, Roblox's programming language!

I really :heart: issues and pull requests, just one way you can help with my projects! :octocat:

Need to choose a license for your project? Try using the [*choosealicense service*](https://choosealicense.com)

***

This allows:

This does **NOT** allow:

To validate this in your project, you **MUST**:
