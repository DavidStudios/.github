## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I make games and build code here on GitHub.

One of my current GitHub+Roblox projects is GuiService, built only on Lua, Roblox's programming language!

Most repositories use the Mozilla Public License 2.0
<br>
<br>
This allows:
* Commercial use (Monetary use)
* Distribution
* Modification
* Patent use
* Private use

This does **NOT** allow:
* Warranty
* Liability
* Trademark use

To validate this in your project, you **MUST**:
* Disclose the source
* Use same license
* A copy of the license should be in the project.
